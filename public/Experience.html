      <li></li>
      <li>Customer  Purchase Behaviour:</li>
      <li>Understand clientâ€™s requirements and objectives of the project</li>
      <li>Understanding the business problem and converting the same into a data problem</li>
      <li>Processing, cleansing and verifying the integrity of data used for analysis in Python</li>
      <li>Identifying the proportion of direct purchases and indirect purchase customers</li>
      <li>Identifying the life time, the period over which customer is maintaining his or her relationship with company</li>
      <li>Built some machine learning (Random forest, SVM) and advanced analytics (Logistic regression and Decision trees) to predict to purchasing probability of a customers.</li>
      <li>Applied data pre-processing techniques such as anomaly of the data and outliers.
      <li>Applied data exclusions on model data.</li>
      <li>Applied the class imbalanced methods to correct the events (SMOTE, oversampling, under sampling techniques)</li>
      <li>To identify the key metrics applied the Bi-variate and multi-variate analysis</li>
      <li>Applied various variable reduction techniques to reduce the dimensions of the data such as information value and VIF, correlation and Chi-Square.</li>
      <li>Provided recommendation to end users.</li>
      <li>Built the logistic and random forest models.</li>
      <li>Checked various model metrics are accuracy, precision, recall and F1-Score.</li>
      <li>Used the Scikit learn, NumPy, pandas and matplotlib </li>
      <li>For data manipulation and sub setting the data used the pandas.</li>
      <li>For pre-processing and model building used the Sklearn package.</li>
